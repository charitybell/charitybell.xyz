title: Homebrew tap
---

Charitybell maintains a [homebrew tap](https://github.com/charitybell/homebrew-charitybell); a collection of software installers that allows for easy installation of software on Linux and MacOS. This tap holds experimental packages, and packages for applications that aren't eligible for inclusion into [homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core) (e.g. due to licensing issues) but are odeserving of easy-to-use installers anyway.

Work on this homebrew tap has led to various small improvements to the applications being packaged. Like this [pull request](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020/pull/488) to gbdk-2020, which improved build times by making the build process run with multiple threads.
